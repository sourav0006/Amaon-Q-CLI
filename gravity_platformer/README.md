# Gravity Platformer

A 3D-inspired platformer game with gravity-based mechanics, implemented in Python using Pygame.

## Features

- Planetary gravity system (toggle gravity centers with 'G' key)
- Collectible stars
- Platform-based level design
- Simple physics system

## Controls

- Arrow Keys: Move left/right
- Space: Jump
- G: Toggle gravity center (when near a planet)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed
2. Install Pygame: `pip install pygame`
3. Run the game: `python main.py`

## Future Enhancements

- Local & online co-op support
- More complex planetary gravity systems
- Wall jumps
- Environmental puzzles
- Boss fights with multi-phase AI
- Advanced UI elements
- Enhanced visual effects
- AWS integration for multiplayer and cloud features

## Development Roadmap

1. Core mechanics and physics (current stage)
2. Level design and game progression
3. Visual and audio enhancements
4. Multiplayer functionality
5. Cloud integration and online features
